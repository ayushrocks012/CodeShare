' Module:      M_Config
' Purpose:     This module defines all global constants and utility functions for the project.
'              It acts as a central control panel for sheet names, column positions,
'              and business logic enumerations.

' Change Log:
' V28.0:       - Implemented Stage 3 maintainability improvements.
'              - Added ReportColumn Type and gTierReportCols global collection.
'              - Added InitializeReportConfig to create a data-driven report structure.
